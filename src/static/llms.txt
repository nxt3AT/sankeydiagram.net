Important notes:

- The basic syntax for a flow is `SOURCE [AMOUNT] TARGET`, with one flow per line.
- There cannot be multiple flows with the exact same source and target.
- The color of a flow can optionally be specified with the syntax `SOURCE [AMOUNT] TARGET [#COLOR_HEX_CODE]`.
- Using the `[?]` operator as amount, all outgoing flows are summed-up for a value
- A concrete example flow would look like this: `salary [20] budget`
- Flows going back to previous nodes are allowed
- Amounts cannot be negative
- Lines starting with `// ` are treated as comments
